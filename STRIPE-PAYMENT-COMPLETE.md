### Step 2: Start Checkout
1. Click **"Proceed to Checkout"** button
2. A form will appear asking for:
   - Full Name (e.g., "John Smith")
   - Email Address (e.g., "john@test.com")
   - Delivery Method (choose one)

### Step 3: Fill in Details
```
Full Name: John Smith

Delivery Method: ✓ Local Pickup (Free)
```

### Step 4: Proceed to Payment
1. Click **"Proceed to Payment"** button
2. You'll be redirected to: **http://localhost:3000/checkout**
3. The page will load the Stripe payment form

### Step 5: Enter Test Card Details
Use Stripe's test card number:

```
Card Number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Expiry Date: 12/34 (any future date)
CVC: 123 (any 3 digits)
ZIP/Postal: 12345 (any valid format)
```

### Step 6: Complete Payment

## 📊 Verify in Stripe Dashboard

   - Status: "Succeeded"
   - Metadata: Contains order ID and order number

### Check Payment Details

  - `customerEmail`: Customer's email

---

## 🗄️ Verify in MongoDB

### Check Orders Collection
1. Open MongoDB Compass or Atlas
2. Navigate to `dymchurch-crafters` database
3. Open `orders` collection
4. Find your order by `orderNumber`

**Expected Fields**:
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "orderNumber": "ORD-20251029-0001",
  "customerEmail": "john@test.com",
  "customerName": "John Smith",
  "items": [...],
  "subtotal": 62.00,
  "deliveryFee": 0,
  "total": 62.00,
  "deliveryOption": "pickup",
  "status": "pending",
  "paymentStatus": "pending",
  "paymentIntentId": "pi_...",

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
**Problem**: Stripe keys not loaded  
**Solution**:
1. Check `.env.local` has correct keys
2. Keys start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_`
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### "Missing checkout information" Error
**Problem**: Cart data not in localStorage  
**Solution**:
1. Go back to `/cart`
2. Fill in the checkout form
3. Click "Proceed to Payment" again

### Payment Form Not Loading
**Problem**: Stripe publishable key issue  
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env.local`
3. Make sure it starts with `pk_test_`

### "Failed to create payment intent" Error
**Problem**: Server-side issue  
**Solution**:
1. Check terminal for error messages
2. Verify MongoDB is connected
3. Check product IDs in cart match real products in database

### Order Not Found After Payment
**Problem**: Order ID mismatch  
**Solution**:
1. Check MongoDB for the order
2. Look at Stripe dashboard metadata
3. Check browser Network tab for API responses

---

## 📝 Current Limitations (Will Fix Next)

1. **No email notifications** - Order confirmation emails not sent yet
2. **Mock cart data** - Using hardcoded product IDs
3. **No webhooks** - Payment status not updated by Stripe webhooks
4. **No order history** - Users can't view past orders yet
5. **Guest checkout only** - No user authentication required

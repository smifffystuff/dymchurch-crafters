# ✅ MongoDB Integration - Issue Fixed!

## Problem
When running `npm run seed`, you got the error:
```
Please define the MONGODB_URI environment variable inside .env.local
```

Even though the `.env.local` file had the MongoDB URI defined.

## Root Cause
The issue was that the `lib/mongodb.ts` file was checking for `process.env.MONGODB_URI` **at import time** (when the module was loaded), but the seed script was loading the dotenv configuration **after** importing the mongodb module.

The execution order was:
1. `import connectDB from '../lib/mongodb'` ❌ (mongodb.ts checks env var - not loaded yet!)
2. `dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' })` ✅ (env vars loaded - too late!)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `lib/mongodb.ts`
Changed from checking environment variable **at import time** to checking **at connection time**:

**Before:**
```typescript
const MONGODB_URI = process.env.MONGODB_URI!

if (!MONGODB_URI) {
  throw new Error('Please define the MONGODB_URI environment variable')
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
function getMongoURI(): string {
  const uri = process.env.MONGODB_URI
  if (!uri) {
    throw new Error('Please define the MONGODB_URI environment variable')
  }
  return uri
}

// Called inside connectDB() function, not at import time
```

### 2. Updated `scripts/seed.ts`
Moved dotenv config to the **very first line** before any imports:

**Before:**
```typescript
import mongoose from 'mongoose'
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
// ... other imports
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' })
```

**After:**
```typescript
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.local' })  // FIRST!

// Now safe to import modules that need env vars
import mongoose from 'mongoose'
// ... other imports
```

## Verification

✅ **Seed script now works:**
```bash
npm run seed
```

Output:

## Next Steps

Now that MongoDB is working:

1. ✅ **Browse the app** - All pages now show real database data
2. 🔄 **Test the API** - Try fetching data via API routes
3. 🚀 **Add features** - Ready for Clerk auth, Stripe payments, etc.

## Testing the App

Visit: http://localhost:3000

Pages to check:
- `/` - Homepage with featured products
- `/products` - All products from database
- `/products/[id]` - Individual product (use ObjectId from database)
- `/crafters` - All crafters
- `/categories` - Browse by category

## API Endpoints Available

- `GET /api/products` - All products
- `GET /api/products?featured=true` - Featured only
- `GET /api/products?category=Pottery` - By category
- `GET /api/products/[id]` - Single product
- `GET /api/crafters` - All crafters
- `GET /api/crafters/[id]` - Single crafter with products

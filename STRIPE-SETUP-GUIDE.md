**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Feature**: Stripe payment processing for Dymchurch Crafters Marketplace

---

## Part 1: Create Your Stripe Account

### Step 1: Sign Up for Stripe
1. Go to **https://stripe.com**
2. Click **"Sign up"** or **"Start now"**
3. Fill in your details:
   - Email address
   - Full name
   - Country: **United Kingdom**
   - Password
4. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Choose Account Type
- Select **"I'm building a platform or marketplace"** (most relevant for your use case)
- Or select **"I want to accept payments for my business"** (simpler option)

### Step 3: Complete Business Profile (Can do later)
For development, you can skip this initially. You'll need to complete it before going live:
- Business type (sole trader, limited company, etc.)
- Business details
- Bank account information (for payouts)
- Identity verification

> **Note**: You can use **Test Mode** immediately without completing business verification!

## Part 2: Get Your API Keys

### Step 1: Access Your Dashboard
1. Log in to **https://dashboard.stripe.com**
2. You'll see a toggle in the top right: **"Test mode"** / **"Live mode"**
3. Make sure **"Test mode"** is ON (it should show a test data banner)

### Step 2: Get Your Test API Keys
1. Click **"Developers"** in the top navigation
2. Click **"API keys"** in the left sidebar
3. You'll see two keys:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`)

4. Click **"Reveal test key"** to see your secret key
5. Copy both keys - you'll need them in a moment

## Part 3: Add Stripe Keys to Your Project

### Step 1: Install Stripe Dependencies
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Step 2: Create Environment File
1. In your project root, create a file called **`.env.local`** (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your Stripe keys:

```bash
# Stripe API Keys (Test Mode)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: 
- Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE` with your actual secret key
- Replace `YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE` with your actual publishable key
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix makes the key available to the browser (safe for publishable keys)
- **NEVER** commit `.env.local` to Git (it's already in `.gitignore`)

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server
After adding environment variables, restart your dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Part 4: Configure Stripe Webhooks (We'll do this later)

Webhooks allow Stripe to notify your app about payment events. We'll set this up after implementing the basic payment flow.

---

## Part 5: Test Cards for Development

Stripe provides test card numbers that simulate different scenarios:

### Successful Payment
- **Card Number**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
- **ZIP**: Any 5 digits (e.g., `12345`)

### Declined Payment
- **Card Number**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- All other fields: same as above

### 3D Secure Required
- **Card Number**: `4000 0027 6000 3184`
- Triggers authentication flow

### More Test Cards

## Part 6: Understanding the Payment Flow

Here's what we'll build:

```
1. Customer adds items to cart
   ‚Üì
2. Customer clicks "Checkout"
   ‚Üì
3. Frontend calls your API to create Payment Intent
   ‚Üì
4. Your API calls Stripe to create Payment Intent
   ‚Üì
5. Stripe returns client_secret
   ‚Üì
6. Frontend shows Stripe payment form (secure iframe)
   ‚Üì
7. Customer enters card details
   ‚Üì
8. Stripe processes payment
   ‚Üì
9. Payment succeeds ‚Üí Order created in MongoDB
   ‚Üì
10. Customer sees confirmation
```

---

## Part 7: What We'll Build

### API Routes
1. **`/api/stripe/create-payment-intent`** - Creates payment intent
2. **`/api/stripe/webhook`** - Handles Stripe events
3. **`/api/orders/route.ts`** - Creates orders in database

### Frontend Components
1. **`/app/checkout/page.tsx`** - Checkout page with Stripe Elements
2. **`/app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`** - Order confirmation page

### Database
1. **Order model** - Store completed orders

---

## Part 8: Cost Information

### Stripe Fees (UK)
- **Online payments**: 1.5% + 20p per transaction
- **No setup fees, no monthly fees**
- Only pay when you get paid

### Example
- Product costs ¬£20.00
- Stripe fee: (¬£20.00 √ó 1.5%) + ¬£0.20 = ¬£0.50
- You receive: ¬£19.50

## Next Steps

Once you've:
1. ‚úÖ Created your Stripe account
2. ‚úÖ Copied your test API keys
3. ‚úÖ Added keys to `.env.local`
4. ‚úÖ Installed Stripe packages

We'll start implementing the payment flow!

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key" Error
- Check that you copied the full key (starts with `sk_test_` or `pk_test_`)
- Make sure there are no spaces before/after the key
- Restart your dev server after adding keys

### "Test mode" vs "Live mode"
- Always use **Test mode** during development
- Test keys start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_`
- Live keys start with `sk_live_` and `pk_live_`
- Never use live keys in development!

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- File must be named exactly `.env.local`
- Must be in project root directory
- Restart dev server after changes
- Check the file isn't named `.env.local.txt`

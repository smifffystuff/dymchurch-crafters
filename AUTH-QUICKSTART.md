# Quick Start: Authentication Implementation

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented a complete authentication system for the Dymchurch Crafters Marketplace using **Clerk**. Here's what's been added:

### 🎯 Core Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up and sign in pages
   - Email/password authentication
   - Social login support (configurable in Clerk)
   - Secure session management

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - **Customer** - Browse and purchase (default role)
   - **Crafter** - Create profile and list products
   - **Admin** - Approve crafters and manage platform

3. **Onboarding Flow**
   - New users choose their role after signup
   - Crafters complete profile setup
   - Smooth user experience

4. **Crafter Dashboard**
   - Profile management
   - Verification status display
   - Quick actions for product management

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - View pending crafter applications
   - Approve or reject crafters
   - Platform management

## 📦 Packages Installed

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs svix
```

## ⚙️ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### 1. Get Clerk API Keys (2 min)

1. Go to [clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and sign up
2. Create a new application
3. Copy your API keys from the dashboard
4. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
```

### 2. Set Up Webhooks (2 min)

For local development, use ngrok:

```bash
# Install ngrok if you haven't
# https://ngrok.com/download

# Start your dev server
npm run dev

# In another terminal, start ngrok
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the https URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

In Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Endpoint**
3. Enter: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`
4. Subscribe to: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`
5. Copy the signing secret
6. Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx
```

### 3. Enable Metadata (1 min)

In Clerk Dashboard:
1. Go to **User & Authentication** → **Metadata**
2. Toggle on **Unsafe Metadata**

### 4. Test It! (30 sec)

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Click "Sign Up"
# Create an account
# Choose your role
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test as Customer
1. Sign up → Choose "I want to Shop"
2. Should redirect to homepage
3. Browse products (existing functionality)

### Test as Crafter
1. Sign up → Choose "I want to Sell"
2. Fill in business details
3. Should see crafter dashboard
4. Notice "Pending Verification" message

### Test as Admin
1. Sign up with any email
2. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Users → Your User
3. Edit **Unsafe Metadata**, add:
   ```json
   {
     "role": "admin",
     "onboardingComplete": true
   }
   ```
4. Refresh app → See "Admin" link
5. Approve pending crafters

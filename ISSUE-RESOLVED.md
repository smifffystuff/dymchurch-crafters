# 🔧 ISSUE RESOLVED - Stripe Payment Integration Fixed

**Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Issue**: Cart, Checkout, and Orders pages returning 404

---

## ❌ The Problem

The cart, checkout, and order pages were being blocked by the Clerk authentication middleware, returning 404 errors because they weren't listed as public routes.

---

## ✅ The Solution

Updated `middleware.ts` to include all payment-related routes as public routes:

```typescript
const isPublicRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/',
  '/sign-in(.*)',
  '/sign-up(.*)',
  '/api/webhooks/clerk',
  '/products(.*)',
  '/crafters(.*)',
  '/categories(.*)',
  '/cart(.*)',          // ✅ ADDED
  '/checkout(.*)',       // ✅ ADDED
  '/orders(.*)',         // ✅ ADDED
  '/api/products(.*)',
  '/api/crafters(.*)',
  '/api/categories(.*)',
  '/api/search(.*)',
  '/api/stripe(.*)',     // ✅ ADDED
  '/api/orders(.*)',     // ✅ ADDED
  '/onboarding(.*)',
  '/api/debug(.*)',
]);
```

## ⚠️ Warnings (Can Be Ignored)

These warnings appear in terminal but DON'T affect functionality:

1. **Mongoose Warning**: `Duplicate schema index on {"slug":1}`
   - This is just a warning about index definitions
   - Doesn't break anything
   - Can be fixed later by cleaning up schema definitions

2. **Images Warning**: `"images.domains" configuration is deprecated`
   - Old Next.js image config format
   - Doesn't affect current functionality
   - Can update to `images.remotePatterns` later

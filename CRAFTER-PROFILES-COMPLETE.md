## 🔗 How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User visits `/crafters` page
2. Clicks on a crafter card
3. Navigates to `/crafters/[id]` (e.g., `/crafters/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011`)
4. Sees full profile with all products
5. Can click on products to view details
6. Can contact crafter via email
7. Can navigate back to all crafters

### Technical Flow:
1. Next.js loads dynamic route `/crafters/[id]/page.tsx`
2. Server component fetches data via `fetchCrafter(id)`
3. API route `/api/crafters/[id]` queries MongoDB
4. Returns crafter data + their products
5. Page renders with full data
6. If crafter not found → shows custom 404

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile (< 640px):** Single column, stacked layout, 128px profile image
- **Tablet (640px - 1023px):** 2 product columns, side-by-side profile info
- **Desktop (1024px+):** 3-4 product columns, large 192px profile image

## 🎨 Components Used

- ✅ `ProductCard` - Reused existing component
- ✅ `Image` from Next.js - Optimized images
- ✅ `Link` from Next.js - Client-side navigation
- ✅ `lucide-react` icons - Mail, MapPin, Package
- ✅ Tailwind CSS - Styling
- ✅ Dark mode support - Via theme context
